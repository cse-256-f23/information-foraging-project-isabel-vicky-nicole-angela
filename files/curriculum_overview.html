      <a id="visual_arts"><h2>Visual Arts</h2></a>
      <p>At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express
        themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as
        important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the
        process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those
        manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a
        successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently
        or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills,
        strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence. Materials and
        experiences include:
      <ul>
        <li>Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk</li>
        <li>Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials
          and items</li>
        <li>Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects </li>
        <li>Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and modeling</li>
        <li>Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling</li>
        <li>Shaping/forming and stringing beads</li>
        <li>Creating collages from any combination of fabrics, paper, pictures, and a variety of threedimensional items </li>
        <li>Building 3-dimensional constructions using boxes, paper tubes, cartons, and other
          recyclable materials</li>
        <li>Creating pictures or structures using wire, clay, wood and other materials</li>
      </ul></p>

      <!-- <h4>Spanish with Miss Colleen</h4> -->
      <a id="spanish"><h2>Spanish with Miss Colleen</h2></a>
      <p>¡Hola! (Hello!) de Señora Colleen (from Miss Colleen)</p>
      <p>
        I am excited to begin my seventh year teaching the Spanish enrichment
        program at WUNS. My philosophy in teaching Spanish is to keep it fun,
        simple and multi-sensory. Whether through song, props, games or
        movement, I like to introduce vocabulary and simple phrases in
        memorable ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a week I will be visiting each classroom for 15 – 20 minutes for
        songs, games and stories in Spanish. On this website, I will list the
        vocabulary we are learning, the lyrics to a song, and/or an overview
        of lessons. Repetition is key to learning, so I will circle back to
        certain lessons throughout the year for review and recall.

      <a id="nature"><h2>Nature on the Move with Miss Becky</h2></a>
      <p>
        I am thrilled to be continuing the Nature on the Move program that has
        been coming to WUNS for 18 years. I believe that one way to preserve
        our natural resources is to teach the youngest members of our society
        to love and respect the natural world around them. Nature on the Move
        allows children to get up close to Missouri’s wildlife and learn how
        each living thing affects the world in which they live. I will visit
        WUNS once per month with a lively presentation on a variety of topics.

      <!-- <h4>Music with Ms. Christina</h4> -->
      <a id="music"><h2>Music with Ms. Christina</h2></a>
      <p>
        I am delighted to be leading music classes at WUNS beginning this
        year! I bring experiences as a musician, educator, and parent. I
        taught kindergarten for 12 years, am a certified Music Together
        teacher, have taught flute lessons, and have played in and directed a
        variety of ensembles. I continue to play flute professionally, but I
        have greatly missed the special energy that lights up when I share
        music and movement with young children, who have an innate desire to
        make playful noise and wiggle their bodies. I am very excited to share
        that joy with all the bears at WUNS…including my own little boy who is
        a Big Bear and Sun Bear.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each season we will enjoy experimenting with a collection of 15-20
        songs. Some will have words and some won’t. Some will be familiar
        children’s tunes, and some will be pieces from genres such as
        classical, jazz, reggae, folk, and more. For some we will use only our
        voice and bodies to create, and for others we will use percussion
        instruments and props like scarves that help us visualize the beats we
        create. All of our repertoire will give us the opportunity to explore
        tone, rhythm, tempo, dynamics, and expressiveness, and all will be
        fun!

      <a id="extra_help"><h2>Extra Help for Your Child</h2> </a>
      <p>The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on
        an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to
        meet students’ needs. <br />
        If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
        of ways, which may include:
      <ul>
        <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
          process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
        <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
        <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
        <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
        <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
          order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
        <li>Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
          concept, skill, or area of concern</li>
      </ul></p>
      <!-- <a id="PT_conferences"><h2>Parent Teacher Conferences</h2></a> -->
      <!-- <p>Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
        students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
        group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
        informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
        and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
        Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
        curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
        child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
        read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.</p> -->
