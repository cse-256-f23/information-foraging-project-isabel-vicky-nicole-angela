      <h1>Home and School Communication</h1>
      <h2>Orientation Day</h2>
      <p>
        This visiting day is usually the day after Labor Day and gives the child 
        and parent(s) an opportunity to visit the classroom and meet the teachers 
        and classmates. This visit is one hour. It will allow time for the child 
        to enjoy free play and also gives parent(s) a brief overview of what to 
        expect during the school year. 
      </p><p>
        The next day, a child will attend school on his/her own (either Wednesday 
        or Thursday, see orientation schedule). The class is divided in half, attending
        on either Wednesday or Thursday. This schedule allows the children and teachers 
        to interact with a small group before the entire class attends on Friday.
      </p>
      <h2>Parent-Staff Communication</h2>
      <p>
        Communication is ongoing throughout the year. Newsletters, the school website 
        and emails give you information on current themes, activities and upcoming events. 
        Phone calls and/or emails by classroom teachers to discuss your child’s adjustment, 
        observations and/or concerns are common. If you feel you need to speak to a teacher 
        or the director, please email or call the office. 
        Teachers can be reached by phone or email after the school day is over.</p>
      <p>
      <h2>Parent-Teacher Conferences</h2>
      <!-- <p>
        The school has two Parent Conferences during the school year. 
        The fall conference is an informal, getting-to-know-the-child-and-family 
        discussion. The spring conference includes a more detailed, written 
        assessment. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time 
        during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.
      </p> -->
      <p>Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
        students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
        group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
        informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
        and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
        Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
        curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
        child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
        read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting. A parent-teacher conference can be scheduled at any time 
        during the year as needed and by request of parents and/or teachers.
