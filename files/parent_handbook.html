        Some important highlights extracted from the Parent Handbook:
      </h2>
      
      <button class="accordion">Parking</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Free parking is available adjacent to the Nursery School. These three, 30-minute spots are typically available during the school day. Parking in Zone 3 is only permitted with a Yellow Zone 3 parking pass. Parents and visitors wishing to have a longer visit should park in the Millbrook or Snow Way parking garages, located off Throop Drive and Snow Way. Visitor parking in these lots is $2.00 for the first two hours. The Nursery School will provide validation tickets to parents that park in the garage for special school events.
          </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Drop-Off and Pick-Up</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          All traffic for arrival and dismissal must proceed from the parking lot entrance west of the school, driving east and stopping at the school entrance. Drivers stay in their cars and teachers help the children enter and exit. Teachers are outside for arrival of children at 8:50 a.m. for the morning session and 12:30 p.m. for the afternoon session. If you arrive late, you must escort your child to the classroom. At dismissal (11:45 a.m. and 3:15 p.m.) children assemble outside the front door on benches or, in inclement weather, inside the front door. No child can be dismissed to anyone other than persons designated (in writing) by the parents. Your child must hold hands with a teacher or parent when in front of the school in the drop-off/pick-up area.
          </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Clothing</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          It is recommended that children be dressed in play clothes that are comfortable, washable, and suitable for activities both indoors and outdoors. Children need to have at least one extra set of clothing appropriate to the season that can be kept at school. Parents should be aware of weather conditions and dress children accordingly, as outdoor play is an integral part of the daily schedule. During the winter months our general guideline for outdoor play is that we will usually go outside when it is above 20 degrees, with wind chill taken into account. Please mark your child’s name in permanent marker on all clothing so that it can be easily identified.
          </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Discipline</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Classroom limits are necessary to provide a sense of order and allow teachers to spend as much time as possible providing a stimulating environment for each child. Our rule of thumb is that children keep themselves safe, keep friends safe, and the toys at school safe. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The staff is trained to anticipate potentially problematic situations; they remind children of appropriate behavior and redirect or intervene when necessary. In most cases, teachers can stop or re-direct behavior before something negative occurs. If not, teachers will first consult the injured party to make sure they are emotionally and physically okay. Then, they will turn their attention to the child who might need more support in “keeping their friends safe” or, more likely, “keeping their bodies safe” with others. Reflection over what has occurred will lead to discovering other behavior options and resolving things with the peer.
        </p>
        <p>
          When inappropriate behavior is a continuing problem, the school will work with parents to understand the issue and make appropriate recommendations. It is our goal to make school a positive, rewarding and enjoyable experience for each child. We realize, however, that we cannot meet the needs of all children and parents. If it is determined that a child is not growing from his/her preschool experience at the Nursery School, a discussion will be held with parents at which it may be decided that this program is not appropriate for the child. The director and teachers will make recommendations of other preschool programs and relevant community services if parents so desire.
        </p>

      <button class="accordion">Holidays</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          We are fortunate to have diverse cultures and religious beliefs in our nursery school community. Our policy is to celebrate family traditions, not the religious aspects, of holidays.
          </p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Field Trips</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Teachers frequently plan short walking trips on campus. Occasionally, trips are planned off- campus to further enhance the children’s experiences. Each time an off-campus trip is planned, parents will be notified in advance and required to sign a form granting permission for the child’s participation.
          </p>
      </div>
      
      <button class="accordion">Birthday Celebrations</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          We celebrate each child’s birthday (or half-birthday for children with summer dates). If desired, talk with your child’s teacher about bringing a special snack to share with the class.
          </p>
      </div>
      
      <button class="accordion">Snacks</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The nursery school provides a healthy snack each day for the children. Fresh fruit (apples, oranges, pears, bananas, melons, etc.) are purchased each week and kept in the “children’s refrigerator.” There are a wide variety of crackers (soda, graham, Ritz, Goldfish, etc.) available. Snack time consists of a fruit, crackers and water. The older children learn to pour their own water.
          </p>
      </div>
      
      <button class="accordion">Health Polices and Emergency Procedures</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The nursery school encourages parents to administer medications at home and <strong>not</strong> at school. The nursery school staff does not routinely administer medications to the children. Also, we do not apply sunscreen or insect repellent. Medication that absolutely needs to be administered during school hours must be cleared with the director.
