      <h1>Policies and Procedures</h1>
      <h2>Parking</h2>
      <p>
      Free parking is available adjacent to the Nursery School. These three, 30-minute spots are typically available during the school day. Parking in Zone 3 is only permitted with a Yellow Zone 3 parking pass. Parents and visitors wishing to have a longer visit should park in the Millbrook or Snow Way parking garages, located off Throop Drive and Snow Way. Visitor parking in these lots is $2.00 for the first two hours. The Nursery School will provide validation tickets to parents that park in the garage for special school events.
      </p>
      <h2>Drop-Off and Pick-Up</h2>
      <p>
      All traffic for arrival and dismissal must proceed from the parking lot entrance west of the school, driving east and stopping at the school entrance. Drivers stay in their cars and teachers help the children enter and exit. Teachers are outside for arrival of children at 8:50 a.m. for the morning session and 12:30 p.m. for the afternoon session. If you arrive late, you must escort your child to the classroom. At dismissal (11:45 a.m. and 3:15 p.m.) children assemble outside the front door on benches or, in inclement weather, inside the front door. No child can be dismissed to anyone other than persons designated (in writing) by the parents. Your child must hold hands with a teacher or parent when in front of the school in the drop-off/pick-up area.
      </p>
      <h2>Clothing</h2>
      <p>
      It is recommended that children be dressed in play clothes that are comfortable, washable, and suitable for activities both indoors and outdoors. Children need to have at least one extra set of clothing appropriate to the season that can be kept at school. Parents should be aware of weather conditions and dress children accordingly, as outdoor play is an integral part of the daily schedule. During the winter months our general guideline for outdoor play is that we will usually go outside when it is above 20 degrees, with wind chill taken into account. Please mark your child’s name in permanent marker on all clothing so that it can be easily identified.
      </p>
      <h2>Holidays</h2>
      <p>
      We are fortunate to have diverse cultures and religious beliefs in our nursery school community. Our policy is to celebrate family traditions, not the religious aspects, of holidays.
      </p>
      <h2>Field Trips</h2>
      <p>
      Teachers frequently plan short walking trips on campus. Occasionally, trips are planned off- campus to further enhance the children’s experiences. Each time an off-campus trip is planned, parents will be notified in advance and required to sign a form granting permission for the child’s participation.
      </p>
      <h2>Birthday Celebrations</h2>
      <p>
      We celebrate each child’s birthday (or half-birthday for children with summer dates). If desired, talk with your child’s teacher about bringing a special snack to share with the class.
      </p>
      <h2>Snacks</h2>
      <p>
      The nursery school provides a healthy snack each day for the children. Fresh fruit (apples, oranges, pears, bananas, melons, etc.) are purchased each week and kept in the “children’s refrigerator.” There are a wide variety of crackers (soda, graham, Ritz, Goldfish, etc.) available. Snack time consists of a fruit, crackers and water. The older children learn to pour their own water.
      </p>
      <h2>Medication</h2>
      <p>
      The nursery school encourages parents to administer medications at home and <strong>not</strong> at school. The nursery school staff does not routinely administer medications to the children. Also, we do not apply sunscreen or insect repellent. Medication that absolutely needs to be administered during school hours must be cleared with the director.
      </p>
      <h2>Health Polices and Emergency Procedures</h2>
      <p>
      For more information about health and emergency policies, such as accidents, allergies, and severe weather procedures, please refer to the <strong>Policies and Procedures</strong> section in the <a class="download" href="downloads/parent_handbook.pdf"> Parent Handbook</a>.
