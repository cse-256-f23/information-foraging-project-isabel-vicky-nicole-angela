      <br/><h1>More Info</h1>
      <h3>Our Space</h3>
      <span class="indent">3-Bears Camp is located in the Washington University Nursery School
        facility on the Washington University campus. It is composed of three
        classrooms and an all-purpose room, which are designed to offer
        children a variety of choices in their play. Our large outdoor play
        area gives children the opportunity to run, bike, swing, climb, slide,
        and play in the sand and water.</span>
      <h3>Food</h3>
      <span class="indent">We provide morning snack and children bring lunch</span>
      <h3>Activites</h3>
      <span class="indent">Since a good number of hours are spent outside during
        summer camp, the nursery school playground provides opportunities to
        cool off with outdoor water play that includes troughs, sprinklers
        and hoses. Building in the sand and playing on the climbing
        equipment are two other favorite outdoor activities. An adjoining
        wading pool is available for summer campers, whether enrolled in the
        swimming classes or not.</span>
      <h3>Swim Class</h3>
      <span class="indent">Children may take advantage of swimming lessons offered as an optional
        program during each session. There will be eight lessons per session,
        at a cost of $65. Children must be toilet trained to participate in
        swimming lessons. The swimming pool is located adjacent to the Nursery
        School.</span>
