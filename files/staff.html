                Nikki’s early education experience spans 15 years. She began
                teaching at WUNS in 2009. Prior to that, she worked as a service
                coordinator for Special School District for six years, providing
                education and support for parents of children with special needs.
                She also served as a social worker in Collinsville, Illinois, for
                three years.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nikki earned her Bachelor of Science degree in kinesiology from the
                University of Michigan and her Master of Social Work from Washington
                University in St. Louis. Inspired by her first science teacher, she
                loves to teach children about science and nature.
              </p>
              <p>
                She enjoys seeing preschoolers explore and discover the wonders in
                their world. WUNS is a special place to work and teach, Nikki
                believes, because the dedicated staff understands the unique needs
                of children. In addition, the campus location makes for special
                opportunities for children to engage with a higher education
                environment.
              </p>

                Nikki, originally from Michigan, has been married to her best
                friend, Chris Scheele, for 21 years, and they call University City
                home. They have two children—son Nick and daughter Parker, both WUNS
                alums. In her free time, Nikki loves to spend time with family and
                neighbors. Her home is known for its get-togethers, particularly
                postseason Cardinal games. Travel is also a favorite hobby; her
                family has visited the Caribbean, Mexico, Brazil and Europe and
                looks forward to new travel adventures every summer.

                Amber has worked at the Nursery School since 2002. She attained her
                Bachelor of Science in education at the University of Kansas (Go

                WUNS children include art activities—she enjoys watching them create
                using different media. Circle time is another favorite of hers, when
                children enjoy listening to stories and predicting what happens
                next, as well as singing and counting to teacher-led prompts. For
                Chona, WUNS is a very special place to teach because of the diverse
                families that enroll. She also appreciates working with her

                Heather Huewe is thrilled to begin her third year teaching at WUNS.
                After staying home for several years to raise four daughters,
                Heather eagerly returned to the classroom and found WUNS to be a
                wonderful fit. Heather was drawn to WUNS for its warm, family
                environment, its collegiality, its professionalism, and the
                opportunity to work not only with young children but also with young
                adults from Washington University in St. Louis. Prior to having her
                daughters, Heather taught first, sixth, and eighth grade over the
                course of twelve years at MICDS, and developed a love for each age
                group. She teams with Suzy in the morning Big Bears.
              </p>
              <p>
                Heather earned her BA in Speech and Communications from the
                University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (go Tarheels!) and an
                MAT in Early Childhood Education from Emory University.
              </p>
              <p>
                A devoted runner for her entire adult life, she will begin coaching
                her tenth season of Girls on the Run this fall, and has completed
                several marathons for charity. Heather is most proud of coordinating
                the annual Race for Refugees, which benefits the International
                Institute of St. Louis. This venture combines her love of running
                with her belief in giving back to our shared community. In her free
                time Heather loves to stay active and get outside with her kind
                husband – and fellow educator – Patrick, their four unique daughters
                Rosie, Grace, Anna, and Mary Catherine, and crazy pup Charlie.
                Together they like to walk to their friendly Olivette neighborhood
                Starbucks, ride bikes to the bookstore (more coffee!), go to the
                zoo, play tennis and soccer, and of course run. Heather also loves
                to read, bake, keep up with current events, and stay connected with
                friends, family, and neighbors (a.k.a. talk…just ask her family!).

                Katie is very excited to begin her fifth year at WUNS, in the 2019 –
                2020 school year teaching with Chona in the Teddy Bear classroom
                (mornings) and Colleen in the Sun Bear classroom (afternoons). She
                has taught kindergarten, first and second grades in the Ladue School
                District for many years.
              </p>
              <p>
                She attained her undergraduate degree in elementary education from
                Creighton University and her Master of Arts in teaching early
                education from Webster University. Katie is inspired by young
                children; she is constantly amazed by how they see the joy in simple
                things. One of her goals as a teacher is to provide an enriching
                environment that naturally fosters curiosity, engaging
                conversations, imaginative play, creative movement, and thoughtful
                expression. She believes WUNS is a special place because of its warm
                and welcoming energy and its unique location on a college campus.
              </p>
              <p>
                Katie and her husband Mike are St. Louis natives. They have four
                children, Alli (21), Jake (19), Elizabeth (17) and Will (14) and a
                dog Murphy, “the best West Highland White Terrier ever.” In her free
                time, Katie enjoys hiking, travel, swimming and being with her
                family.

                Miriam is thrilled to join the WUNS community this year as a teacher
                in the Bear Cub classroom. Having previously worked with the Bear
                Cubs during summer camp, she is excited to be back at the nursery
                school and working with such a dedicated and warm group of teachers,
                students and families.
              </p>

                Miriam attended the University of Colorado-Boulder, where she earned
                BA degrees in Spanish Literature and Elementary Education, as well
                as her MAEd in Curriculum and Instruction with an emphasis on
                Literacy, Language and Culture. She spent seven years teaching
                elementary school in Denver, at a private bilingual school in Mexico
                and with the School District of Clayton.

                After spending time at home with her three children, Miriam began
                substitute teaching at area preschools and she most recently taught
                preschool at New City School. She loves working with preschool-aged
                children because of their unique opportunity to learn through play,
                creative expression and exploration.

              <p>
                Miriam and her husband have two daughters and a son. When she is not

                Science in Early Childhood Education from the University of
                Missouri-Columbia. She has taught young children for a total of 18
                years, 6 in kindergarten and more recently 12 in Pre-K. Becky and
                her husband Randy have been married for 26 years and have four
                children, all currently in college. Becky and Randy love to spend
                time on their property in Northeastern Missouri near Mark Twain Lake
                where they enjoy watching and listening to all the wildlife,
                fishing, boating, and riding their horses. Becky believes that one
                way to preserve our natural resources is to teach the youngest
                members of our society to love and respect the natural world around
                them. Nature on the Move allows children to get up close to
                Missouri’s wildlife and learn how each living thing affects the
                world in which they live.

                taught kindergarten for 12 years, am a certified Music Together

                a variety of ensembles. I continue to play flute professionally, but
                I have greatly missed the special energy that lights up when I share
                music and movement with young children, who have an innate desire to
                make playful noise and wiggle their bodies. I am very excited to

                volunteering with our church, neighborhood groups, and—of course!—at
                WUNS. I also love to read, play flute and piano, do anything artsy
